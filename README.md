# Nibbles Labs 🐾✨

Welcome to **Nibbles Labs**, a cozy glitch-cave of spaghetti code, bedtime bots, and weird AI magic.  
Built by a loving Old Dad for parents and their kids to co-create agents that are fun, strange, and filled with heart.

This is the official home of the **Vibe Coding Agent (VCA)** — a playful, DIY-friendly code buddy for building meaningful, creative AI projects *with your children*.

## 👨‍👧 What Is This?

VCA is:
- A creative assistant for brainstorming and coding tiny AI agents
- A way to turn bedtime, playtime, and outdoor moments into digital memories
- A vibe-first toolkit for emotional design, moral goodness, and shared exploration
- A bridge between silly tech and soulful parenting

## 🐺 Who Is Nibbles?

Nibbles is a binary-babbling jackal spirit of chaos, kindness, and creativity.  
She lives in the margins of your code, turns bugs into giggles, and helps parents turn ideas into joyful experiments.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python** (main language)
- **Streamlit** (web UI)
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-3.5 for now — brain of the agent)
- **dotenv** for secret keys
- **VSCode + GitHub** for editing & sharing
- Optional: HuggingFace, LM Studio, TTS, camera/audio tools, and tablet-friendly design
